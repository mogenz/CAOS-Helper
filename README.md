# CAOS Helper :)

This project contains several Python scripts, each serving a specific purpose related to computer science concepts. Below is a brief description of each file:

## Files and Descriptions

### 1. `2scompliment.py`
This script calculates the two's complement of a given binary number.

### 2. `binary-calc.py`
Performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) on binary numbers.

### 3. `circuit-truth-table.py`
Generates the truth table for a given digital circuit.

### 4. `cpu-arrival-time.py`
Simulates CPU scheduling and calculates arrival times of processes.

### 5. `digital-logic.py`
Evaluates digital logic expressions and outputs the result.

### 6. `disk-access.py`
Simulates disk access patterns and calculates seek time.

### 7. `hextable.py`
Converts a given input to its hexadecimal representation and generates a hex table.

### 8. `page-table-size.py`
Calculates the size of a page table for a given memory configuration.

### 9. `roundrobin.py`
Implements the Round Robin scheduling algorithm for process management.

### 10. `virtual-memory.py`
Simulates virtual memory management including paging and page replacement algorithms.

## Usage

Each script can be run individually using Python. For example:
```sh
python 2scompliment.py
